# Final Project Proposal
## 
I am going to make Tetris.
pieces of different geometric forms
I will have a square mesh and some effects in different colors. Then I will create tetriminos in different geometries with the mesh and effects. I will generate the tetriminos from the top and make the tetriminos drop.  The player can move the pieces laterally and rotate them by using a controller or keyboard until they touch the bottom of the field or land on a piece that had been placed before it. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the blocks placed above fall one rank.
I will bind the roration and movement functions to the inputs by using my Controller System.
I will use the Audio System(https://iriswuyuhan.wixsite.com/yuhan-wu/post/audio-project-v1-0) made by Yuhan Wu to add music effect. I will: 
Add background music.
Play different kinds of audio when getting input from the keyboard and the controller. 
Play audio when the line is completed.
